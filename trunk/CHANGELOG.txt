Core Changes since v0.2:

- Removed dependency upon shlwapi.
- As a workaround for better IME support, you may now disable the internal keyboard-hook and inject keyboard/IME messages directly from the main window's WindowProc.
- Alpha-picking (the filtering of mouse clicks by transparency) is now implemented.
- In the HikariManager, global mouse-movement events are now broadcast to all Flash overlays instead of only the top-most control

Bugfixes since v0.2:
- FlashControl overlays weren't being sorted correctly by z-order during focus, this has been fixed.
- Patched up a memory leak in FlashControl, thanks to Adis.
- Applied a potential workaround for heap corruption due to Ogre::DisplayString in FlashControl::callFunction.
